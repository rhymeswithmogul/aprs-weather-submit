/* As we begin our function definitions, you'll notice that "extern" is inside
   an #ifndef statement everywhere it occurs. This is because OpenWatcom's POSIX
   linker doesn't recognize these functions when they're marked as extern.  So,
   if this is a DOS build, the user is likely using OpenWatcom, so we'll ignore
   these externs and the inlines in aprs-wx.c.	*/
