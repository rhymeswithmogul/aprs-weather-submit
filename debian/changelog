aprs-weather-submit (2.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * We have our own TOCALL destination! This app can now identify itself
    using the `APWXS?` destination, so that the various APRS tracking
    sites can identify this app without the user agent.  (I thought this
    was worthy of a major version bump!) (Closes: #19, #31, #33)
  * In addition to the above, anyone who forks this project can now
    easily pick their own TOCALL at compile-time by editing the TOCALL
    macro in `src/main.h` or supplying `-DTOCALL=APZxxx` in `$CFLAGS`.
    (Closes: #19)
  
  * The command-line option `--debug` has been added to toggle debugging
    output at runtime. Thanks for the suggestion, DL9SEC! (Closes: #18)
  * As a result, the `--enable-debug` compile-time option (that sets
    `-DDEBUG`) has been removed. (Closes: #22)
  * However, if you _really_ need the smallest-possible binary, there is
    a new flag, `configure --disable-debugging`, that will remove all
    debugging capability. This might be useful if you're compiling for a
    microcontroller or other embedded system. (Closes: #22)

  * Added the "Z" device type field, as noted in the document, "APRS
    version 1.2.1 WEATHER UPDATES TO THE SPEC". (Closes: #20, 21)

  * Fixed a low-severity security bug involving the use of `gmtime()`.
    This has the limited potential to be unsafe, so I replaced it with
    a call to `gmtime_r()`. (Closes: #25, #26) (Security: CWE-676)

  * Various little improvements. (Closes: #27, #28)
