aprs-weather-submit (2.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

* We have our own TOCALL destination!  This app can now identify itself
  using the `APWXS?` destination, so that the various APRS tracking
  sites can identify this app without the user agent.  (I thought this
  was worthy of a major version bump!)
* In addition to the above, anyone who forks this project can now
  easily pick their own TOCALL at compile-time by editing the TOCALL
  macro in `src/main.h` or supplying `-DTOCALL=APZxxx` in `$CFLAGS`.

* The command-line option `--debug` has been added to toggle debugging
  output at runtime. Thanks for the suggestion, DL9SEC!
* As a result, the `--enable-debug` compile-time option (that sets
  `-DDEBUG`) has been removed.
* However, if you _really_ need the smallest-possible binary, there is
  a new flag, `configure --disable-debugging`, that will remove any and
  all debugging capability.  This might be useful if you're compiling
  for a microcontroller or other embedded system.

* Added the "Z" device type field, as noted in the document, "APRS
  version 1.2.1 WEATHER UPDATES TO THE SPEC".

* Fixed a low-severity security bug involving the use of `gmtime()`.
  This has the limited potential to be unsafe, so I replaced it with a
  call to `gmtime_r()`.
