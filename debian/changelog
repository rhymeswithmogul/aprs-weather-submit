aprs-weather-submit (1.8-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Converted all I/O to non-blocking in case of network issues or APRS
    server outages.  (Thanks to DL9SEC for pointing this out.)
  * Thus, there is a new parameter, `--timeout`, which will let you set
    a custom timeout value of your choice.  (Use `--timeout 0` for the
    old blocking behavior.)
  * Fixed a bug where `./configure --disable-aprs-is` was not honored by
    the configure script.
  * Added support for ISO-compliant compilers such as `gcc --pedantic`.
  * Code cleanup.
