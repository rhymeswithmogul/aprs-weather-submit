aprs-weather-submit (1.8.2-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Fixed a bug where v1.8.1 would not handle timeouts correctly using
    the Win32 API.  macOS and Linux users are not affected.
  * Fixed incorrect behavior in APRS server negotiation.  The `vers`
    field expects the app name and version, separated by a space;
    however, I was separating it with a forward slash instead.  I don't
    know if this matters or not, but it should still be fixed.
