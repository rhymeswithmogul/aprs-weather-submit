aprs-weather-submit (2.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Noted that APRS weather reports containing weather data (except for
    wind speed and direction) cannot have custom icons.  This is a lim-
    itation of the APRS protocol itself.  Thanks to SQ9RHX for being
    patient while I investigated. (Closes: #30)

  * The temperature field is no longer mandatory, as many APRS viewing
    implementations have gotten more lenient.  Thus, an empty `t...` is
    no longer included when temperatures are not specified.  To undo
    this, compile the app with `-D_STRICT_APRS_COMPLIANCE`.

  * A security change in version 2.0 would not compile on DOS because
    `gmtime_r()` isn't part of the C99 standard.  Now, for DOS plat-
    forms, we revert to using `gmtime()`. (Closes: #36)

  * Fixed a bug where flooding information would be reported as an
    order of magnitude less than the intended value.

  * Fixed a bug where battery voltage would be reported without the
    decimal part.

  * Performance tweaks for systems without a floating-point unit or
    with a slow floating-point unit.

  * Code cleanup and minor performance improvements for APRS-IS.
