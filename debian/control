Description: Manually submits weather station information to the APRS-IS network
 Not everyone has a fancy weather station with APRS connectivity built in.
 Maybe you are like me, and have an old-school thermometer and CoCoRaHS-approved
 rain gauge. This command-line app can compile on most Linux toolchains and will
 manually submit APRS 1.2.1-compliant information via APRS-IS.
